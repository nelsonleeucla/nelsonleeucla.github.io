Hi! I'm Nelson, a senior psychology student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I have developed a strong foundation in research, marketing, sales, customer service, and management through various academic roles, professional positions, and extracurricular activities. I’m passionate about applying these skills in roles that involve team collaboration, problem-solving, and driving results.

I am actively seeking opportunities that offer challenging experiences, where I can both develop my existing skills and acquire new ones.

Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about fitness, basketball, and fashion. I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and my dog, Tea. I also have a personal goal of reading one book each month, focusing on either self-help or memoirs, in order to foster personal growth and broaden my perspective. My personal favorite so far would be <I>Atomic Habits</I> by James Clear, as its practicality and straightforward writing often serve as a reference for improving my behavior.
