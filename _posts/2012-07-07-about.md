Hi! My name is Nelson, and I am a senior psychology student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I have developed a strong foundation in management, marketing, research, and sales through various academic roles, professional positions, and extracurricular activities. Iâ€™m passionate about applying these skills in roles that involve team collaboration, problem-solving, and driving results.

I am actively seeking opportunities that offer challenging experiences, where I can both develop my existing skills and acquire new ones.

Outside of my professional life, I am passionate about fitness, basketball, and fashion. I enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and my dog, Tea. I also have a personal goal of reading one book each month, focusing on either self-help or memoirs, in order to foster personal growth and broaden my perspective. My personal favorite so far would be <I>Atomic Habits</I> by James Clear, as its practicality and straightforward writing often serve as a reference for improving my behavior.
