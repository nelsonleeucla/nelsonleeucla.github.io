<!-- Before beginning this project, I had no experience in website development or coding. I wasn't even sure about which platform to use for creating my site. I considered options ranging from simpler solutions like Google Sites to more personalized but costly alternatives like Squarespace. It was through the recommendation of my friend (Shout-out Chiemeka!), that I began exploring alternative methods of site creation, which led me to discover GitHub.


Further researching online, I discovered that while there is an initial learning curve in basic web coding, utilizing Jekyll and GitHub is a widely recommended approach. Seeing this as an opportunity to expand my skill set, I embraced the challenge. 

Through extensive online resources, including video tutorials, forums, and blogs, as well as the support from my friends who patiently helped me with my endless amount of questions, I gradually grew my knowledge. I learned what exactly VS Code, GitGub Codespaces, version control with Git, CSS files, and various web development tools and concepts actually were and how to efficiently utilize them. I also acquired basic HTML coding skills throughout this process. Overall, this experience proved to be immensely valuable, and I now have a greater appreciation for both website design and coding.

<h1>Design</h1>

Using GitHub, I forked the <a href="https://jekflix.rossener.com/">Jekflix</a> Jekyll theme by Thiago Rossener as a starting point and extensively customized it to create my personal website. The direction I chose for my website's design was a minimalistic and professional feel. -->

</div> -->

<!-- I began by changing the site's main theme color to a cooler and more mature cobalt blue to compliment the black and white overlay. Additionally, I streamlined the interface by removing several buttons and pages to enhance the overall minimalistic aesthetic.

In the experience, skills, and education pages, I chose to incorporate a card layout format to organize the information presented. To provide additional visual interest to the minimal design of these pages, I incorporated an interactive hover effect on the cards. When a user moves their cursor over a card, a simulated reflecting light appears, adding visual interest and engagement to the interface

</div>

In the experience section, in which I intentionally omitted any images to avoid overcrowding the text-heavy content, I enhanced the page's visual appeal by incorporating a blue light that continuously cycles from the top to the bottom. This design choice also aims to encourage viewers to scroll down, guiding them to explore additional experiences.

<!-- Looking ahead, I have several pages and ideas to enhance the site's user experience that I would like to implement. If you encounter any errors on my website or have any feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out. Your input is greatly appreciated! -->
